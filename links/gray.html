                <p>Following the first World War, 1914-1918, relatives of the killed service personnel were given a “death plaque” or memorial medal showing the name of the dead person.  These plaques or medals were individually cast in bronze.  Most were issued to men, and their legend (inscription reads, “HE DIED FOR FREEDOM AND HONOUR”.  The medal was designed by Mr. E. Carter Preston of Liverpool, England.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The medal would have been given to Margaret Anne Boyle, his wife.  Later she gave it to her oldest daughter, Barbara Alexena Chisholm.  And later she gave the medal to her son, James Gray.  James passed away in 2020 and his family found the medal while sorting through his things.  James’ sister, Margaret, was in turn, given the “Next of Kin Memorial Scroll” by her mother, also featured in this article.  </p>
